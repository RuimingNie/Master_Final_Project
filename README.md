# Master_Final_Project

#All figures and analysis in the statistical analysis section of the thesis can be generated using the provided code (Master_Project_R_Script.R) and data (LAI.CSV, All_species_traits.xlsx, Soil_Texture_Analysis, and juv_hec.csv)

# In addition, the data of the Leaf area index is obtained by analysing all panoramic photos through the Cano.py function (python) provided by Francis Wimdram. Since the Cano.py function is not formally published yet, I  attached the analysed LAI data (LAI.csv). Please let me know if you need panoramic photos before analysis.
